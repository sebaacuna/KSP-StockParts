title = 'Drill-O-Matic' Mining Excavator
manufacturer = Kerbodyne
description = Designed to help extract valuable resources from the crust of planets and asteroids, the Drill-O-Matic uses a rotary drill combined with an internal transfer auger to pull crushed regolith into holding tanks for later processing.  When operated by a skilled engineer, you will be able to operate with better efficiency.
