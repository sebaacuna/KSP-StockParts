	description = The OKTO2 is far more than a flatter variant of the original OKTO. This new iteration of the ubiquitous 8-sided probe core features a much more advanced guidance system. This new model however, does not feature built-in reaction wheels and does requires more power to run, even on standby. Its internal battery supply is also very limited, being intended mainly to keep the Standby LEDs lit.
