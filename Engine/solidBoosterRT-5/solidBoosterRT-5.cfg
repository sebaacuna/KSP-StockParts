	title = RT-5 "Flea" Solid Fuel Booster
	description = While considered by some to be little more than "a trash bin full o' boom", The RT-5 can be seen in use at many space programs, perhaps possibly because it is the only option for many space programs, but nevertheless, this small booster provides a nice kick to lift small payloads to considerable heights. Use with caution, though. Once lit, solid fuel motors cannot be put out until the fuel runs out.
