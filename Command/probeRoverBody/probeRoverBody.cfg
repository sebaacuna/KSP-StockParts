	description = A sturdy housing for a robust probe and battery system - no assembly required! Thought intended as the body for surface rovers, we've been told by our most day-dreaming of engineers that the possibilities are endless! While it has a Stability Assistance System, the RoveMate lacks reaction wheels so bring some along if you want to hold that attitude.
