	title = IX-6315 "Dawn" Electric Propulsion System
	manufacturer = Ionic Symphonic Protonic Electronics
	description = By emitting ionized xenon gas through a small thruster port, Dawn can produce incredibly efficient propulsion, but with a downside of very low thrust and high energy usage. According to ISP Electronics sales reps, the rumours of this engine being powered by "dark magic" are largely exaggerated.
