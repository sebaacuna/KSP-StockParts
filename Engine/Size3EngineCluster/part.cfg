	manufacturer = Kerbodyne
	description = Kerbodyne engineers got fed up with having to contend with overly complicated staging arrays for lifting heavy payloads, and decided instead to just build a truly enormous engine of the highest efficiency. Strapping together four of Kerbodyne's KS-25 rocket motors in a single assembly, they created the largest rocket engine in production anywhere, and each KS-25 has the highest chamber pressure--the reason for four small nozzles and combustion chambers, not one big one (those kept going boom). It's certainly got the power to match its size, and although it excels in its main role as a first-stage engine, the lack of structural hardpoints on its underside makes it quite less suitable for other purposes. Its price tag also seems to match its size, in fact.
