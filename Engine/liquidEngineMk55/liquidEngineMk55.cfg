	description = After an intensive search for an engineer crazy enough to plan and build a revolutionary new engine type, researchers turned to  renowned engineer Eumon Kerman, one of the top minds in the industry. He failed miserably at the job, and this is what we ended up with. Hey, at least it works well with other (Rockomax) large (Rockomax0 engines when you want more control. Sorry, no combo deals.
